This font (the files Material-Design-Iconic-Font.{eot,svg,ttf,woff{,2}}
is reproduced verbatim from the dist/fonts/ subdirectory of its homepage
at: https://github.com/zavoloklom/material-design-iconic-font
(This means that this is not a “Modified Version” in terms of the OFL,
because it is an “Original Version” in terms of the OFL.)

The font is, according to the CSS file reproduced in the file
../css/material-design-iconic-font.css, covered by the SIL OFL 1.1,
a complete copy of which is shipped in the file OFL.txt in this
directory. The Original Version does not contain any copyright
notice to reproduce, nor does the homepage.

While the font is unmodified, it is generated (by upstream) from
a number of SVG files, which can all be inspected in the homepage
at the above-mentioned URL.
